NOTES:
    What to do when player stats for a year don't exist
    Load Full batting order tables
    Swap teams at Half
    Batting order can currently include players who are not in the field
        - Have set_up_batting_order only pull from the fielders
    Add documentation
    fix roster scraping, not every table is in the updated form
    use BR advanced batting pitch summary for pitch-by-pitch stats
    make sure to update batting order if pitcher gets switched out
    add stolen bases
    clean up setting the pitcher
    load only the necessary rows of the table
        - Maybe load an average row too?
    Cleaner DH settings
        - Maybe team takes in a "uses_dh" arg
