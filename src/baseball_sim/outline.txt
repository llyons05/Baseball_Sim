NOTES:
    Load Full batting order tables
    Add better documentation
    Baseball reference is slowly changing tables, make sure to stay up to date
    use BR advanced batting pitch summary for pitch-by-pitch stats
    add stolen bases
    load only the necessary rows of the table
        - Maybe load an average row too?
    Cleaner DH settings
        - Maybe team takes in a "uses_dh" arg
    Make an iterator to iterate through table rows
    Add walk offs, ie inning can end early if the other team cannot win
    auditing should actually check whether player file contains year data
