NOTES:
    Load Full batting order tables
    Add better documentation
    Baseball reference is slowly changing tables, make sure to stay up to date
    use BR advanced batting pitch summary for pitch-by-pitch stats
    add stolen bases
    load only the necessary rows of the table
        - Maybe load an average row too?
    Cleaner DH settings
        - Maybe team takes in a "uses_dh" arg
    Make an iterator to iterate through table rows
    Add walk offs, ie inning can end early if the other team cannot win
    Players who are both starting pitchers and hitters in the same game make the sim think that this team uses a DH, when this may not be the case
        - Ex: Shohei Ohtani
    Add a stat container to teams and players that accumulates stats as the games are played
