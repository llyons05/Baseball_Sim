NOTES:
    What to do when player stats for a year don't exist
    Load Full batting order tables
    Add better documentation
    Baseball reference is slowly changing tables, make sure to stay up to date
    use BR advanced batting pitch summary for pitch-by-pitch stats
    Change pitcher after every game
        - Give each pitcher a cooldown (ex: 5 games)?
    add stolen bases
    load only the necessary rows of the table
        - Maybe load an average row too?
    Cleaner DH settings
        - Maybe team takes in a "uses_dh" arg
    Change table format to only hold columns to save space on repeated headers
    Get League Stats on a per-year basis (more stats available this way)
