NOTES:
    Load Full batting order tables
    Add better documentation
    Baseball reference is slowly changing tables, make sure to stay up to date
    Be careful when using methods that mix stats from different tables
    load only the necessary rows of the table
        - Maybe load an average row too?
    Cleaner DH settings
        - Maybe team takes in a "uses_dh" arg
    Make an iterator to iterate through table rows
    Players who are both starting pitchers and hitters in the same game make the sim think that this team uses a DH, when this may not be the case
        - Ex: Shohei Ohtani
        - This becomes an issue with older teams
        - If the newer stats don't exist, create a method that uses the older stats to simulate
    Add a stat container players that accumulates stats as the games are played
    Use league stats to get % of SBOs on certain bases
    Add minimum number of plate appearances rather than just catching 0
    Add double plays
        - DPs are just subset of outs
        - If a play results in an out, and there is a runner on first, we can roll for a double play
        - Stats needed:
            - DPopp + DPs (Situational batting)
            - DPopp + DPs (Ratio Pitching)
        - Be aware of potential advantage for older teams where there can be no batting double plays
    Add sac flies
        - Sac flies are also a subset of outs
        - If a play results in an out, and there is a runner on third, we can roll for a sac fly
        - Stats needed:
            - Sac Flies (std batting) + <2,3B (Situational batting)
            - Sac Flies (batting against) + <2,3B (Baserunning against)
    What to do if man on first and third w/ <2 outs and play is an out?
        - Both sac fly and DP are possible, but it can't be both
        - Which do we roll for first??
        - Make it so there are 3 possible outcomes on any given out:
            - Player is out
            - Double play (always 0% if there is nobody on first)
            - Sac fly (always 0% if there is nobody on third)
        - Pick one of the there
        - These other types of outs are included in the total number of outs, so we must subtract them from total before taking prob
    Fix up the class constructors they are very messy
