NOTES:
    What to do when player stats for a year don't exist
    Load Full batting order tables
    Swap teams at Half
    Implement better base running logic (use baseball reference's Baserunning stats)
        - Check how often a player on first makes it to third on a single
    Batting order can currently include players who are not in the field
        - Have set_up_batting_order only pull from the fielders
    Add documentation
    fix roster scraping, not every table is in the updated form
